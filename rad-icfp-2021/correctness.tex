\section{Correctness}

%decompose the macro from section 4 into unary form transfo, then principled macro, then opti
\MH{Question: when is it best to give the idea about our macro? that it's UNF+macro+easy-opti?}
\MH{probably won't use UNF in this paper, because not implemented, not proved enough, and I don't have my notes. but might be a small section too because it's easy without general HO. maybe something to say for map/folds.}
