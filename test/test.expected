variable:
x1
term:
exp (x1)
reverse derivative macro of term:
⟨exp (x1), λy2,y1. (λy0. {y0})[(y2 + (exp (x1) * y1))]⟩
derivative of term:
(λy2,y1. (λy0. {y0})[(y2 + (exp (x1) * y1))])[0., 1.]
partially reduced term:

let y0 = (y2 + (exp (x1) * y1)) in
{y0}
fully reduced term:
let y0 = exp (x1) in
{y0}
